## Where is it?

We're located on floor 2 in the [Q building at KTH Main Campus](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Malvinas+V%C3%A4g+4,+114+28+Stockholm/@59.3501665,18.0647645,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465f9d6b2e04a231:0x50419256350f01a1!8m2!3d59.3501665!4d18.0669532). Just enter the Q building, go down the stairs and on your left you should see a door with our logo and a big camera hanging at the entrance.
