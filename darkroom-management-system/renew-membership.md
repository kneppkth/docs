# Renew membership

When your current membership expires in 30 days or less you will be able to renew it via the [user dashboard](https://knepp.se/user/dashboard) so that you don't loose access to the darkroom. The process is quite similar to when [becoming a new member](become-a-new-member.md) and the payment options are identical. Please make sure to select the right THS membership before confirming any new subscription so that you pay the right amount.
